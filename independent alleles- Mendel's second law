Exercise code : lia
Excercise goal : Assuming independent allele's according to Mendel's Second Law, What is the probability there will be at least 'N' AaBb organisms
after 'k' generations (just final, not including parents)?
k - how many generations to pass
N - how many AaBb organisms in final generation

'''
def prob_het(k,N):

    prob_AaBb = 4/16 
    
    #the probability to get heterozygous AaBb is exactly 1/4 regardless of the combination

    prob = []
    total = 2**k # number of offsprings at k generation since each generation has 2 offsprings
    
    # since the question asked for at least N number of heterozygous offsprings at k generation, 
    we need to cover all possible scenarios from N -> total offsprings are heterozygous
    for i in range(N,(total+1)):
      prob.append(nCr(total,i)*(prob_AaBb**i)*((1-prob_AaBb)**(total-i)))
    return sum(prob)
